method (use_a_plan) caused trouble for the sle case.

Thu Feb 16, 2006: Released Refine 1.2.10

Can now cache the current grid and map for linear interpolation of
original map function. Continued with a Phased approach to
adaptation, where the second phase is modify CAD faces only. A direct
approach is tried with gridfacer. Made the production parallel
adaptation use a plan to attack ever edge longer than one in metric
(longest edge first) Created a tableau implementation of simplex
method for linear programming to untangle mesh via Freitag untangling.
Added methods to eradicate wedge and sliver cells. 
Able to run le case 0.01 easily, 0.002 harder, 0.001 (250:1) with
difficulty.

Tue Nov 22, 2005: Released Refine 1.2.9

Tried inserting boundary surface directly into grid to split domain
into interior and exterior portions. (The exterior is discarded.) This
line of resreach was discontuied after complexities with curved
boundaries overwhelmed attempts.

For curvilinear grids, started a main driver to make quadradic,
meshes. Work extend to high-order still ongoing.

Added a sorted priority to address worst elements first durring
adpation (nicknamed a plan).

Started a Phased approch to adaptation, where the first phase is
modify CAD edges only. A direct approach is tried with gridedger.

Thu Jul 28, 2005: Released Refine 1.2.8

The grid insert methods gridSplitEdgeRatio and gridCollapseEdge
interpolate and evaluate edge t, face uv, and xyz in a consistent
manner. Modified gridcad simplex volume searches to use min jacobian
determinates when gridCOST_CNST_VALID cost constraint active.
gridCostValid gridmetric method consistantly checks cost constraints.
Added logic to unit_main to make an invalid curved element mesh valid.
Modifies the gridSwap, gridSmooth, gridAdaptLongShort to priorities
operation to do ops on worst thing first.  With an update in the SDK
(tagged version 1.1.5) modifed gridfiller gridSavePart to set
consistant uvs to aviod projection issues.  Added tecplot cell and
equator outputs to debug grid.  Worked on Valid curved quad element
meshing.

Tagging to test new direction for linear elements.

FUN3D API change: gridsetcostconstraint_ and gridconstrainsurfacenode_
added for valid meshing with flow solver (not parallelized yet)

Thu Jun  2, 2005: Released Refine 1.2.7

Snapshot after Toronto AIAA paper, before `valid' adaptation research.
Improved the logic involved with smoothing on surface to allow its
use in parallel.
Included a check of geometry face parameter orientation of surface
to fix a bug that scrambled surface nodes durring adaptation.
Added a Face UV area constraint bit to cost constraints.
Uses CADGeom_ResolveOnFace and CADGeom_ResolveOnEdge calls to safely update
CAD parameters on the boundaries of faces and edges.
Created a plan.c object to store list of entities to adapt.
The plan list is created in parallel (during FUN3D runs) to
reduce the time of seqential ghost updates.
Allow border opertations in colors to speed up large 100+ processor runs.
CAPRI verson 2 compatability added as #define's
Reduced execution time of removing unused global nodes
and cells by replacing order n^2 operation.
Started work on validating invalid method.
Changed edge split to use a ratio of two node locations not an explicit
new node location.

Tue Jan 31, 2005: Released Refine 1.2.6

Split and collapse only project when the validity cost constraint is
activated. Face swapping was added to parallel partition interiors.
The OM6 example case runs.

Tue Jan 31, 2005: Released Refine 1.2.5

The -DSURFACE_VALIDITY path has been merged into the mainline code.
Node smoothing hierarchy: edge nodes move to improve geometry edge
lengths, surface nodes more to increase face mean ratio, and volume
nodes move to improve volume.  Cost constraints (volume,validity) can
be turned on and off with bitwise switches.  Adapted nodes are
projected and new faces are added to correctly evaluate surface
validity.  Fixed a parallel geom edge memory bug in
gridSortNodeGridEx.  The OM6 example case runs two iterations, but
generates surface grid cliffs due to projection durring adaptation.

Tue Jan 25, 2005: Released Refine 1.2.4

To save stable snapshot before merging the -DSURFACE_VALIDITY path
into the mainline code.
Continued unit mesh research into edge based adaptation and

Added a texinfo refine manual, refine/doc/refine.texi.

./configure with --enable_CAPRI2 to activate).  Imposed limits on the
minimum element quality allowed after a edge split or collapse.  Added
functionality to untangle surfaces triangles in UV space.  Correctly
handle adaptation on geometry that has been transformed in the
SDK. Various FORTRAN API changes that require a compatible version
of FUN3D. 

Started on research into edge-based operator adaptation. Cost function
for grid improvement is selectable with gridSetCostFunction.

Wed Aug 17, 2004: Released Refine 1.2.2

Fixed FAKEGeom.

Wed Aug 17, 2004: Released Refine 1.2.1

Removed all references to SDK UG_API and Goolache from the refine lib;
you will only need to link to GEOLAB SDK CADGeom and MeatLib.  Added
static versions of SGI n32 CADGeom+CAPRINative and MeatLib in
geomSGIn32; see INSTALL for usage. Silenced reporting of CAD parameter
mismatches on restart. Note that there is a bug in the recreation of
CAPRI restarts that still needs to be fixed, but projecting points
works for all geometries tested so far.  Limited the range of R
(aspect ratio) to reduce the number of cases that the linear elasticity
system goes unstable with Gauss-Seidel. Use springs if the linear
elasticity system goes unstable. I have noticed an extra node or cell
reported by the load balancing routine in FUN3D on rare occasions for
large grids on may processors. I have not been able to isolate
problem.

Wed Aug  9, 2004: Released Refine 1.2.0

Replaced obsolete SDK/Goolache/MeshMgr with SDK/UG_API methods.  The
combination of removing cells from the mesh with two boundary triangles

fix the few negative elements that result from linear elasticity grid
movement to perform surface projection.
