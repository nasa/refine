Refine is a 3D tetrahedral grid adaptation framework. It is
implemented with an object-oriented flavor in the C language.  Most
functionality is wrapped into Ruby scripting language extensions
<http://www.ruby-lang.org/> for use in test first programing and unit
testing. See the README.EXT file in the Ruby distribution for details
on ruby extensions. 

CAD geometry access is facilitated with the NASA Langley Geomerty
Labratory SDK <http://geolab.larc.nasa.gov/>, which assess CAD
information with the CAPRI API
<http://raphael.mit.edu/capri/docs.html>.

MesherX is an advancing layer mixed-element mesher
<http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/~garimell/thesis/THESIS-FULL.PDF> that
interacts with the SDK to rebuild the inviscid protions of the grid.

See the INSTALL file for build instructions.
